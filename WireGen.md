# WireGen Audit

## Opportunity:

• What problems does this tool solve?
• How can it improve current processes?

- it can solve creative block and improve initial design process,
- speeds up process by creating unlimited wireframes,
- it also provides text descriptions of best practices,
- it can create multiple pages withing the same wireframe design from one prompt,
- it detects how many pages would be needed from the context

## Risks:

• What are the potential downsides?
• Are there security or compliance concerns?

- it may produce generic wireframes (not for unique designs),
- what you get depends on your prompt and may not be the best outcome,
- it's not always following the best practices (not using all available space),
- we not sure if's up top todays design standards

## Tangible Benefit

- could save **Techforge** money by speeding up wireframe process,
- gives detailed description,
- can save **Techforge** money for training employees on UX/UI training,
- can add it to Figma board and edit it.

## Evaluation

• Does the benefit outweigh the risk?
• Would you recommend adoption?

- there are no security risks,
- can be amended so the final design always meet th user needs and expectations,
- would recommend under certain circumstances (lack of designers in a company, lack of time or money)
- it gives opportunity to create up to 25 pages with a free version.
