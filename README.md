# AI tools audit for **Techforge**

# Github Copilot Audit

## Opportunity
### Key Points:
- Suggests code snippets to speed up development process.
- Has better context than other AI tools.
- Can help you refactor your app.
- Helps combat errors by referring to your code.
- Gives you typo hints prevent errors.

GitHub Copilot addresses several key challenges in software development. It suggests code snippets that help speed up the development process and offers better contextual understanding than many other AI tools, as it can read your files automatically. Copilot aids in refactoring code, identifying and preventing errors by referring directly to your codebase, and even provides typo hints that help prevent common mistakes.

Furthermore, Copilot can serve as a learning tool for junior developers, exposing them to best practices, patterns, and libraries that they might not have been aware of, which can help them improve their coding skills over time.

## Risks
### Key Points:
- You may become reliant on copilot auto completions which may lead to code quality concerns.
- Can provide outdated solutions.
- Can provide you with a solution that has security risks.

There are potential downsides to using GitHub Copilot. One of the main concerns is becoming overly reliant on its autocomplete features, which may lead to code quality issues. Additionally, Copilot might suggest outdated solutions or introduce security risks, which could lead to compliance concerns within organizations.

Additionally, there are intellectual property concerns, as Copilot could suggest code snippets derived from open-source repositories that may not comply with certain licenses.

## Tangible Benefit
### Key Points:
- Beneficial but may cost TechForge more to rectify security risks created by copilot.
- Can save time and increase productivity

The use of GitHub Copilot offers clear benefits, such as cost savings, increased productivity, and significant time savings in development. However, these benefits must be weighed against the potential costs of rectifying any security vulnerabilities it might introduce.

## Evaluation
### Key Points:
- Worth to try using the free trial (cheaper for organisations).
- Recommended for teams using Github repositories.

In conclusion, while GitHub Copilot presents certain risks, its benefits may outweigh them in many cases. It is worth exploring, particularly through the free trial, and is recommended for teams using GitHub repositories, especially organizations looking for cost-effective development solutions.




# WireGen Audit

## Opportunity
### Key Points:
- Solves creative block and can improve initial design process.
- Speeds up process by creating unlimited wireframes.
- Provides text descriptions of best practices.
- Creates multiple pages withing the same wireframe design from one prompt.
- Detects how many pages would be needed from the context.

WireGen offers several solutions for streamlining the UX/UI wireframing process. It helps overcome creative blocks and enhances the initial design phase by generating an unlimited number of wireframes quickly (if paid for). Additionally, it provides text descriptions outlining best practices, which can improve design quality. WireGen can also create multiple pages within a single wireframe design from one prompt, determining the number of pages required based on context. This feature can significantly speed up workflows.

## Risks
### Key Points:
- May produce generic wireframes (not for unique designs).
- The outcome is dependent on your prompt and may not be the most suitable.
- Not always following the best practices (bad use of white space).
- May not be aligned with todays design standards.

While WireGen has benefits, there are potential downsides. The tool may produce generic wireframes, which may not be ideal for unique or tailored designs. The quality of the output heavily depends on the prompt, and the results may not always align with the best possible outcome. Additionally, WireGen may not utilize all available space efficiently, and there is some uncertainty regarding whether it meets today's design standards.

## Tangible Benefits
### Key Points:
- Could save **Techforge** money by speeding up wireframe process.
- Can save **Techforge** money for training employees on UX/UI training.
- Can add it to Figma board and edit it.


WireGen could save TechForge time and money by accelerating the wireframe creation process. The detailed descriptions it provides could also reduce the need for UX/UI training for employees. Its seamless integration into Figma boards allows for further customization and editing, making it adaptable for different needs. This flexibility can reduce costs associated with design training and revisions.

## Evaluation
### Key Points:
- No security risks.
- Can be amended so the final design always meets the user needs and expectations,
- Recommended under certain circumstances (lack of designers in a company, lack of time or money)
- Gives opportunity to create up to 25 pages with a free version.

In evaluating the tool, it appears that the benefits of WireGen outweigh the risks. There are no apparent security concerns, and the tool can be customized to ensure that the final design meets user needs and expectations. WireGen would be a good fit in scenarios where a company lacks sufficient design resources, time, or budget. Additionally, the free version allows the creation of up to 25 pages, making it a cost-effective solution for small to medium-sized projects. Therefore, adoption could be recommended under specific circumstances.
