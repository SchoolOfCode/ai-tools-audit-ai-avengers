# Github Copilot Audit

## Opportunity

GitHub Copilot addresses several key challenges in software development. It suggests code snippets that help speed up the development process and offers better contextual understanding than many other AI tools, as it can read your files automatically. Copilot aids in refactoring code, identifying and preventing errors by referring directly to your codebase, and even provides typo hints that help prevent common mistakes.

Furthermore, Copilot can serve as a learning tool for junior developers, exposing them to best practices, patterns, and libraries that they might not have been aware of, which can help them improve their coding skills over time.

## Risks

There are potential downsides to using GitHub Copilot. One of the main concerns is becoming overly reliant on its autocomplete features, which may lead to code quality issues. Additionally, Copilot might suggest outdated solutions or introduce security risks, which could lead to compliance concerns within organizations.

Additionally, there are intellectual property concerns, as Copilot could suggest code snippets derived from open-source repositories that may not comply with certain licenses.

## Tangible Benefit

The use of GitHub Copilot offers clear benefits, such as cost savings, increased productivity, and significant time savings in development. However, these benefits must be weighed against the potential costs of rectifying any security vulnerabilities it might introduce.

## Evaluation

In conclusion, while GitHub Copilot presents certain risks, its benefits may outweigh them in many cases. It is worth exploring, particularly through the free trial, and is recommended for teams using GitHub repositories, especially organizations looking for cost-effective development solutions.
